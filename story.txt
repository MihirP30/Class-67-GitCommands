Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkeywho resided in a berry tree. In the same forest lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The monkey offered him some fruits. After accepting them, the crocodile then came back the next day for more fruits. He continued like this until they slowly started building a friendship.
